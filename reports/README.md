# Reports

This directory contains the output of our data analysis project, including visualizations and the final report.

## Structure

- `figures/`: Contains images generated by `visualizer.py`
- `final_report.qmd`: Quarto document for generating the final report

## Generating the Report

We use Quarto to generate a comprehensive PDF report from our analysis. Here's how to create the report:

1.  **Ensure Quarto is installed**: If you haven't installed Quarto yet, follow the instructions at [quarto.org](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/).

2.  **Update the Quarto document**: Open `final_report.qmd` and ensure all sections are up-to-date with your latest analysis findings.

3.  **Include visualizations**: Reference the images in the `figures/` directory within your Quarto document using Markdown syntax:

    ```markdown
    ![Description of the figure](figures/figure_name.png)
    ```

4.  **Open a terminal in this directory and run**:

```python
quarto render final_report.qmd --to pdf
```

5.  **Review the output**: After rendering, you should see `final_report.pdf` in this directory. Open it to review your report.
